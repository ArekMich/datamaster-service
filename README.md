### Calling Protected APIs

Once youâ€™ve obtained the access token using the login API,
 you can call any protected API by passing the accessToken in the Authorization 
 header of the request like
```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```
 The JwtAuthenticationFilter will read the accessToken from the header, verify it, 
 and allow/deny access to the API.
